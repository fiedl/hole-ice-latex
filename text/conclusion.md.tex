\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

- Key results
- Outlook
- Detector Calibration Can/Cannot (?) Be Improved by Simulating Local Ice Properties Like Hole Ice
- Suggested Follow-up Studies
  - Flasher studies to find hole-ice parameters

- this study
- direct hole-ice proapgation
- nested cylinders
- individual dom displacement relative to hole ice
- cables
- direct detection
- this means more calibration parameters
- and minor effects like effective reflection
- in bulk ice same propagation
- but shielding of the doms for strong hole-ice parameters
