\subsection{Ice Features Not Considered in This Study}
\label{sec:ice_features_not_considered}



- this study
- direct propagation through cylinders of different ice properties
- and direct detection as acceptance criterion

- not considered
- gradient in hole ice radially
- gradient in hole ice z direction

- Tilted DOM Positions
- Gradient in Hole-ice Properties

- Schwankungen beim Bohren in der x-y-Ebene, vgl. Notizen 2018-01-23.

- bring back ice tilt #48
- bring back ice anisotropy #48

- full geometry file with cylinders and cables #61
- performance impact of full geometry file
- subject to follow-up study
