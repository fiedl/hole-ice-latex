% Why is it important?
% What is needed to understand the work?
% How will the work be presented?
% Definitions and key terms

## What is IceCube
## IceCube as Particle Physics Laboratory
## IceCube as Deep-space Neutrino Telescope
## Improving the Detector Resolution Through Calibration
## Can Local Ice Properties be Implemented in Simulations Aiming to Improve Calibration?

# Theoretical Background
## Neutrinos
## Relevant Neutrino Reactions
## Photon Model
## Scattering Model

# Experimental Background
## IceCube Detector
## Digital Optical Modules (DOMs)
## DOM Angular Acceptance Characteristics
## Current Approximations and Their Limitations
% Outdated model for hole-ice properties
% No different properties for each string/DOMs
% DOM is wrongly considered centred in hole ice
## Event Reconstruction
## Likelihood Methods for Comparing Simulations to Reference Data
## Ice Models to Characterize Photon Scattering And Absorption
## Hole Ice As Region with Different Ice Properties Around Detector Strings

# Simulation Background
## Parallal Computing
## Photon Propagation Algorithm
## `clsim` Photon Propagator

### Unit Testing
## Implementing Cylinder-shaped Areas with Distinct Ice Properties
### Hole-ice Cylinders
### Nested Cylinders With Different Properties
### Cables With Instant Absorption
## Example Studies
### Basic Scattering Properties
### Instant Absorption
### Shifting the DOMs Relative to the Hole-ice Cylinder
### Cable Shadows
## Parameter Grid Scan to Find Hole-ice Properties
### Based on Reference Simulation
