## Simulating Nested Hole-Ice Columns
## Simulating the Displacement of Optical Modules Relative to the Hole-Ice Columns
## Simulating Shadowing Cables as Opaque Cylinders
## Scanning Hole-Ice Parameters for the Best Agreement with Flasher Calibration Data

# Discussion
% What do the results mean?
% Why is it interesting?
% What does it change?

## Improvements for Detector Callibration

## Comparison to Other Hole-Ice-Propagation Software
% ppc
% approximation with standard clsim
% inkl. performance-vergleich

## Performance Considerations
% taugt f√ºr low-energy-studies

## Ice Features Not Considered in this Study
### Tilted DOM Positions
### Gradient in Hole-ice Properties

# Conclusion
% Key results
% Outlook
## Detector Calibration Can/Cannot (?) Be Improved by Simulating Local Ice Properties Like Hole Ice
## Suggested Follow-up Studies
% Flasher studies to find hole-ice parameters
