\subsection{How to Switch Back to Standard-\clsim's Media-Propagation Algorithm}
\label{sec:how_to_switch_media_propagation}

In order to switch back to the standard \clsim algorithm, even after the new code has been merged into the \icecube simulation framework, the standard \clsim code is provided as drop-in replacement.

\sourcepar{The standard \clsim code as drop-in replacement can be found at \url{https://github.com/fiedl/clsim/blob/sf/hole-ice-2018/resources/kernels/lib/propagation_through_media/standard_clsim.c}}.

To apply this code, switch in `propagation_kernel.c.cl` from calling `apply_propagation_through_different_media()` to `apply_propagation_through_different_media_with_standard_clsim()`.

Also check \url{https://github.com/fiedl/hole-ice-study/issues/115} whether an `IceTray` switch has already been implemented.
