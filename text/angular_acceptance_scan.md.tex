\subsection{Scanning the Angular Acceptance of an Optical Module}
\label{sec:angular_acceptance_scan}

\icecube's digital optical modules (DOMs) are more sensitive to accepting, that is to say to registering incoming photons from certain direction as from others.

This is due to the detector design as the photomultiplier tube (PMT) is facing downwards as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:weihee6X} (a). Therefore, a photon coming from below is more likely to hit the PMT and be detected than a photon coming from above. Also losses due to glass and gel transmission effects as well as the quantum and collection efficiencies of the PMT depend on the impact angle of the incoming photon \cite{icepaper}.

Figure \ref{fig:weihee6X} (b) shows the measured \textbf{angular acceptance} $a\dom(\eta)$ of the IceCube DOMs by plotting the \textbf{relative sensitivity} from lab measurements for each polar angle representing the direction of incoming photons. \cite{icepaper} The \textbf{sensitivity} is the fraction of the incoming photons that are registered by the detector. The sensitivity is normalized \textbf{relative} to the optimal incoming angle, which is from below, where the relative sensitivity is defined to be 1. Note that the polar angle $\eta$ is measured from below: For photons coming from below, $\eta = 0$. For photons coming from above, $\eta = \pi$.

The ``hole ice'' curve $a\domhi(\eta)$ is based on previous simulations using the \noun{Photonics} software \cite{lundberg} approximating the effects of the hole ice on the sensitivity for registering incoming photons. To create the ``hole ice'' curve with simulations, a hole-ice cylinder of $30\cm$ radius and a geometric scattering length of $50\cm$ (so-called ``H2 parameters'') have been assumed. \cite{holeicestudieswithyag,icemodelsdata} Plot taken from \cite{icepaper}, figure 7.}{\halfimage{ice-paper-fig7}}

\subsubsection{Expected Effect of Hole Ice on the Angular Sensitivity}
\label{sec:hole_ice_effects}

The effect of hole ice on the detection of incoming photons is expected to depend on the polar angle $\eta$ of the incoming photons. \cite{icepaper} When the photons are coming from the side, $\eta = \sfrac{\pi}{2}, \cos \eta = 0$, the distance that incoming photons need to travel through the hole ice is minimal. Therefore, the effect of the hole ice is expected to be minimal for photons from this direction.

For photons approaching the optical module from below, $\eta = 0, \cos \eta = 1$, the hole-ice effect should be strong as the distance that photons need to travel through the hole ice is maximal. The photons are likely to be scattered away before reaching the optical module, effectively reducing the sensitivity for photons approaching the optical module from below as shown in figure \ref{fig:weihee6X} (b) by the blue curve in the region of $\cos \eta = 1$.

For photons approaching the optical module from above, $\eta = \pi, \cos \eta = -1$, the hole-ice effect should also be strong as the distance that photons need to travel through the hole ice is maximal. The optical module is very insensitive to registering photons coming from above. But propagating through the hole ice, photons approaching the optical module from above are likely to be scattered away before reaching the optical module. There is a chance that those photons travel around the optical module and finally hit the module at a lower position in the sensitive area. This effectively increases the sensitivity of the module for photons approaching the optical module from above as shown in figure \ref{fig:weihee6X} (b) by the blue curve in the region of $\cos \eta = -1$.


\subsubsection{Measuring the Effective Angular Acceptance With Simulations}
\label{sec:measuring_angular_acceptance_with_simulations}\label{sec:gauging}

In order to quantify the hole-ice effect on the angular acceptance of \icecube's optical modules for different hole-ice models, this study performs a series of simulations, starting photons from different angles $\eta_i$ towards an optical module and counting the photons registered by the optical module.

The simulation records the number $N(\eta_i):= N$ of started photons for each angle $\eta_i$, as well as the number $k(\eta_i)$ of registered hits for each angle. The relative hit frequency is $h(\eta_i)$.

\begin{equation}
  h(\eta_i) = \frac{k(\eta_i)}{N}
\end{equation}

To make this relative frequency $h(\eta_i)$ comparable to the DOM's angular acceptance $a\dom(\eta)$, which is defined such that $a\dom(\eta = 0) = 1$, this study often uses a renormalized relative frequency $\tilde{h}(\eta_i):=g\,h(\eta_i)$ with a gauging factor $g\in\reals$ such that $\tilde{h}(\eta = 0) = 1$.

\begin{equation}
  \tilde{h}(\eta_i) = g\,h(\eta_i), \ \ \
  g = \frac{1}{h(\eta = 0)}
  \label{eq:gauging_factor}
\end{equation}

\sourcepar{A script to configure and perform these kinds of simulations is provided in \script{AngularAcceptance}.}


\subsubsection{Photon Sources: Pencil Beams and Plane Waves}
This study considers two types of photon sources for angular-acceptance studies, pencil beams and plane waves. Both are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:quie8Oof}.

One simulation is performed for each angle $\eta_i$. Photons are started from a distance $d$ from the center of the optical module. In the case of pencil beams, photons are started at a fixed position for each angle $\eta_i$ such that it approaches the optical module under this angle as shown in figure \ref{fig:quie8Oof} (a).

In order to approximate plane waves as photon sources, photons are not started from fixed positions but from random positions within a plane that is located in a distance $d$ from the center of the optical module and oriented perpendicular to the distance vector as shown in figure \ref{fig:quie8Oof} (b).

Due to the limitation of computational resources, rather than simulating plane waves with infinite extent, an arbitrary extent $e$ of the plane is chosen. \rongen \cite{martindardupdate,rongenswedishcamera} compares the influence of the plane extent $e$ on the angular-acceptance curves (\cite{martindardupdate}, slides 6 and 9). The angular-acceptance simulations described in the section arbitrarily choose a plane extent $e = 1\m$ and a start distance $d = 1\m$.\footnote{For follow-up studies, an extent of $e=2\m$ and a distance of $d=2.5\m$ should be chosen as photon-source parameters, because the angular-acceptance curves become stable for these or larger parameters. \cite{rongenswedishcamera}}

Note that the gauging factor $g$ (equation \ref{eq:gauging_factor}) depends on the photon source and needs to be redetermined when changing the photon source, that is to say when switching between pencil beams and plane waves, or when changing the distance $d$, or the plane extent $e$.

Figure \ref{fig:Paihah7h} shows a \steamshovel visualization of simulated photons started from a pencil beam, figure \ref{fig:Aehi7kae} for photons started from a plane.

\subsubsection{Acceptance Criterion: A Priori Angular Acceptance or Direct Detection}
\label{sec:acception_criterion}\label{sec:a_priori_angular_acceptance}

In each simulation step of the photon-propagation simulation, the algorithm checks whether the photon intersects the sphere representing a optical module between two scattering points (see section \ref{sec:standard_photon_propagation_algorithm}). At this time, the intersection position and the direction of the photon are known. Based on that information, in order to model the sensitivity of the optical module, the simulation needs to decide whether the module accepts the hit, that is to say considers the incoming photon to be registered, or to ignore the hit.

This study considers two approaches to this decision-making process: Accept the hits based only on the measured \textbf{angular acceptance} $a\dom(\eta)$ of the optical module and the directions of the incoming photons, or accept the hits based only on the location of the sensitive photomultiplier area and the positions of the hits. The latter method is called \textbf{direct detection} \cite{martinspicehddard}. Both approaches are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:kieQuoh1}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \halfimage{direct-detection}
  \caption{Acceptance criteria: The DOM on the left-hand side accepts or rejects incoming photons as hits based only on the direction of the photon (``angular acceptance''). The DOM on the right-hand side accepts or rejects incoming photons only based on the impact position that determines whether the sensitive area of the photomultiplier tube has been hit (``direct detection''). Image taken from \cite[slide 17]{martinspicehddard}.}
  \label{fig:kieQuoh1}
\end{figure}

Using only the photon direction as acceptance criterion, is the default approach in \clsim. This method has the advantage that both, the location of the photomultiplier tube, and other angular-dependent characteristics such as its quantum efficiency, can be abstracted into a single angular-acceptance function that only depends on one parameter, the photon direction.

In \clsim, the angular acceptance $a\dom(\eta)$ of \icecube's optical modules has been implemented as polynomial.

\begin{equation}
  a\dom(\eta) = \sum_{j = 0}^{10} b_j\,\cos(\eta)^j, \ \ \ \eta \in [0; \pi]
  \label{eq:anominal}
\end{equation}

\begin{gather*}
   b_0 =  0.26266,  \ \  b_1    =  0.47659,   \ \ b_2 =  0.15480,  \\
   b_3 = -0.14588,  \ \  b_4    =  0.17316,   \ \ b_5 =  1.3070,   \\
   b_6 =  0.44441,  \ \  b_7    = -2.3538,    \ \ b_8 = -1.3564,   \\
   b_9 =  1.2098,   \ \  b_{10} =  0.81569
\end{gather*}

\sourcepar{The polynomial parameters for different angular-sensitivity models like $a\dom(\eta)$, also called \enquote{nominal} or \enquote{h0} model, and other models that include hole-ice approximations, called \enquote{h1}, \enquote{h2}, and \enquote{h3}, can be found in \icecube's source repository within the \noun{ice-models} project: \url{http://code.icecube.wisc.edu/projects/icecube/browser/IceCube/projects/ice-models/trunk/resources/models/angsens}.}

In this study that focuses on the propagation through hole ice, the photons are expected to frequently scatter, that is to say to change their direction in close proximity to the optical module. In this scenario, using the position of a hit rather than only the direction, is of interest, in particular as, according to \rongen \cite{martinspicehddard}, direct detection is needed to distinguish different hole-ice models, and has been implemented for this study in \clsim as alternative to the standard angular-acceptance method.

\docpar{The implementation of direct detection is documented in \issue{32}.}

The most accurate approach to modeling the sensitivity of the optical modules to registering incoming photons would be to take both, the hit position, and the photon direction into account. The position would account for whether the photon would hit the sensitive area of the photomultiplier tube. The impact angle would account for angular-dependent transmission effects and for the quantum efficiency of the tube. Combining both approaches in \clsim, however, is considered out of scope of this study.\followup

Also, this study does not consider inclined orientations of the optical modules, but always assumes that the modules are oriented along the $z$-axis.\footnote{To check if DOM orientations have been implemented at the time of reading, check \url{https://github.com/fiedl/hole-ice-study/issues/53}.}

\subsubsection{Angular-Acceptance Simulations Without Hole Ice}
\label{sec:angular_acceptance_simulations_without_hole_ice}

In order to compare the different approaches regarding photon sources and acceptance criteria, angular-acceptance simulations have been conducted using the new propagation algorithm, but without any hole-ice cylinders.

\docpar{These angular-acceptance simulations without hole ice have been documented in \issue{98}.}

Figure \ref{fig:Shai8yah} shows the results of the angular-acceptance scans, comparing the above approaches, each also in comparison to the a priori angular-acceptance curve $a\dom(\eta)$ from \cite{icepaper} (``nominal'' curve in figure \ref{fig:weihee6X}).

  \label{fig:Shai8yah}
\end{figure}

The first simulation, using pencil beams and the a priori angular acceptance as acceptance criterion, figure \ref{fig:Shai8yah} (a), follows the a priori angular acceptance curve $a\dom(\eta)$ by design. When deactivating scattering and absorption in the bulk ice entirely, all photons would hit the optical module, and all photons would have still the original direction. All non-angular acceptance criteria would be absorbed in the gauging factor $g$ and both curves, the simulation curve and the a priori curve, would match exactly in the limit of many started photons, $N\rightarrow\infty$.

When switching from pencil beams to plane waves, figure \ref{fig:Shai8yah} (b), more photons approaching the optical module from above, in the region of $\cos \eta = -1$, are accepted because there are photons that start from above, but from a $x$-$y$ position such that they will fly by the DOM and then be scattered and hit the DOM with an angle that is accepted by the DOM. This effect increases when increasing the extent $e$ of the plane waves.

% \todo{Double check this by starting a plane wave with a smaller extent, for example 50cm.} -> https://github.com/fiedl/hole-ice-study/issues/112

When switching to direct detection as acceptance criterion, figure \ref{fig:Shai8yah} (d), the a priori angular acceptance $a\dom(\eta)$ is no longer put into the simulation. Nevertheless, the simulation curve and the a priori curve have roughly the same shape. \rongen argues that the dominant factor for the shape of the angular-acceptance curve is determined by geometrical considerations \cite{martindardupdate}, which are reproduced by the simulation with direct detection.

Further studies could investigate whether finding the proper plane extent $e$ and starting distance $d$ would suffice to make both curves match. Also, the bulk-ice scattering length, which is not infinite in these simulations, could lead to a systematic error, which should be investigated in follow-up studies.\footnote{To check for progress on that matter, see \url{https://github.com/fiedl/hole-ice-study/issues/108}.}\followup

When switching to pencil beams with direct detection, figure \ref{fig:Shai8yah} (c), the simulation essentially becomes a scan for where the sensitive area of the photomultiplier tube ends in the optical module (compare figure \ref{fig:kieQuoh1}).


\subsubsection{Angular-Acceptance Simulations With Hole Ice}
\label{sec:angular_acceptance_simulations_with_hole_ice}\label{sec:hole_ice_approximation}
With the new propagation algorithm, angular-acceptance simulations can be performed, gathering the relative frequencies $\tilde{h}(\eta_i)$ for photons started under an angle $\eta_i$ being accepted as hits by the optical module, but this with a hole-ice cylinder surrounding the target optical module.

In a first attempt, arbitrary properties for the hole-ice cylinder are used, assuming a cylinder radius $r:=r\dom$ being the same as the radius $r\dom$ of the optical module, and assuming an arbitrary effective scattering length $\lambda\hi\esca = 1\m$.

\docpar{These angular-acceptance simulations with hole ice are documented in \issue{99}.}

Figure \ref{fig:eVapie9t} shows the results of the angular-acceptance scans with hole ice, comparing the different approaches (direct detection vs. angular acceptance, and plane waves vs. pencil beams), each in comparison to the a priori effective angular-acceptance curve $a\domhi(\eta)$ from \cite{icepaper} that approximates the effect of hole ice.

\begin{equation}
  a\domhi(\eta) = \sum_{j = 0}^{10} b_j\,\cos(\eta)^j, \ \ \ \eta \in [0; \pi]

\end{figure}

When using plane waves as photon sources, figure \ref{fig:eVapie9t} (b) and (d), the behavior of photons approaching the optical module from below matches the a priori curve $a\domhi(\eta)$ \cite{icepaper} already reasonably well for these hole-ice parameters.

The next sections \ref{sec:vary_radius} and \ref{sec:vary_sca} show effective angular-acceptance curves from simulations with different hole-ice parameters.


\subsubsection{Varying the Hole-Ice-Cylinder Radius in Simulations}
\label{sec:vary_radius}

With the new medium-propagation algorithm (section \ref{sec:algorithm_b}), the hole-ice parameters can be varied.

\docpar{Implementing angular-acceptance simulations for different hole-ice-cylinder radii is documented in \issue{82}.}

Figure \ref{fig:neiyi3Al} (a) shows angular-acceptance curves from simulations with different hole-ice-cylinder radii. In these simulations, the hole-ice cylinder's center is set to be the center of the optical module. The effective scattering length of the hole ice is fixed, $\lambda\esca\hi = 50\cm$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \subcaptionbox{Varying the radius of the hole-ice cylinder.}{\halfimage{angular-acceptance-vary-radius-82}}\hfill
  \subcaptionbox{Varying the scattering length of the hole ice.}{\halfimage{angular-acceptance-vary-esca-83}}\hfill
  \caption{Comparison of angular-acceptance simulations with different hole-ice parameters. For larger hole-ice radii and smaller hole-ice scattering lengths, the angular-acceptance curves show a stronger effect of the hole ice on the detection of photons at the optical module. The blue curve shows the a priori angular-acceptance curve $a\domhi(\eta)$ from \cite{icepaper} that approximates the effect of the hole ice. LLH gives the log-likelihood value of comparing the simulation curve to the a priori curve using a binomial likelihood function.}
  \label{fig:neiyi3Al}
\end{figure}

When the hole-ice-cylinder radius is larger in the simulations, the hole-ice effect is stronger because the ice volume occupied by the hole-ice cylinder is larger, making it more likely that photons approaching the detector module scatter within the hole ice.

When increasing the hole-ice-cylinder radius, photons approaching the optical module from above (left-hand side of figure \ref{fig:neiyi3Al} a) are increasingly scattered ``around'' the optical module such that they hit the optical module in the sensitive area at the bottom, resulting in more accepted hits.

Photons coming from below (right-hand side of figure \ref{fig:neiyi3Al} a) are increasingly scattered away before reaching the optical module when increasing the hole-ice-cylinder radius, resulting in less hits.


\subsubsection{Varying the Hole-Ice Scattering Length in Simulations}
\label{sec:vary_sca}

In another series of simulations, the scattering length of photons propagating through the hole-ice cylinder is varied.

\docpar{Implementing angular-acceptance simulations for different hole-ice scattering lengths is documented in \issue{83}.}

Figure \ref{fig:neiyi3Al} (b) shows angular-acceptance curves from simulations with different hole-ice scattering lengths. In these simulations, the hole-ice cylinder's center is set to be the center of the optical module. The radius of the hole-ice cylinder is fixed to $r = 30\cm$.

When the scattering length within the hole-ice cylinder is shorter, photons propagating through the cylinder scatter more often.

For smaller scattering lengths, photons approaching the optical module from below (right-hand side of figure \ref{fig:neiyi3Al} b) are more likely to be scattered away in the hole ice before reaching the optical module, resulting in less hits.

On the left-hand side of figure \ref{fig:neiyi3Al} (b), where the photons are approaching the optical module from above, the effect of varying the scattering length is less prominent as compared to varying the cylinder radius (\ref{fig:neiyi3Al} a). The detection of photons approaching the optical module from above requires that photons flying by the optical module are scattered into the sensitive area of the module. For a plane wave of photons approaching the module from above, this is much more likely when increasing the hole-ice radius as compared to shortening the scattering length.

Both series of angular-acceptance simulations, varying the hole-ice scattering length and varying the hole-ice-cylinder radius, confirm qualitatively the expected hole-ice effects (section \ref{sec:hole_ice_effects}).

In agreement with figure \ref{fig:neiyi3Al}, \rongen suggests
that the scattering length of the hole ice determines the position of the maximum of the angular-sensitivity curve, the hole-ice radius dominantly determines the strength of the reduction of the sensitivity in the region of $\cos \eta \approx 1$. \cite{pocam}

Additional angular-acceptance simulations using hole-ice parameters suggested by other studies, will be presented in section \ref{sec:angular_acceptance_comparison}.
