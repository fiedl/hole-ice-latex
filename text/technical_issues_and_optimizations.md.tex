\subsection{Technical Issues and Optimizations}
\label{sec:technical_issues_and_optimizations}

- Running simulation of millions of photon scattering and propagation processes
- performance requirements
- parallelization opportunities
- technical challenges

- complexity issues -> tests: \mref{unit testing and consistency checks}
- computing limits -> cluster, parallelization, thinning, optimizations: this section

\paragraph{Simulation-Step Parallelization}
- dima's image

\paragraph{Cluster Parallelization}
- different, simular, but different configurations, e.g. cluster scan \mref{} on several machines in parallel

\paragraph{Issues Concerning Graphics Processing Units}
Running and developing the propagation software for a cluster of graphics processing units, has provided challenges special to this architecture / unexpected. A list of technical issues that might prove useful in follow-up studies, is provided in appendix \ref{sec:gpu_technical_issues}.

\paragraph{General Ray-Tracing-Optimization Techniques}
- ray-tracing list 2017-05-26 -> \todo{bibliography}
- simplify on paper first, but use vectors
- also \mref{background section on parallel programming}

\paragraph{Performance Profiling}
- performance profiling #69 #70 and memory optimization, gprof, 2018-05-24 25 26.

\paragraph{Parallel-Programming Optimizations}
- parallelization #76
  - filter by range separately #30
  - order mathematical cases by frequency

\paragraph{Memory Optimizations}
- memory optimization #69 #70

\paragraph{Performance Optimizations for Production Use}
- production build without prints and debug outputs #73
- kernel caching #15
