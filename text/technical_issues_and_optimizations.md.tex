\subsection{Technical Issues and Optimizations}
\label{sec:technical_issues_and_optimizations}

- a list of technical issues to watch out for in follow-up studies, including caching, numerical, and memory allocation issues, can be found in appendix \mref{}.

- \todo{check numerical issues: are the unclean-cut issues really from numerical issues or caused by the 3d-projection issue?}

### Technical Issues

- driver issue: isnan #16, caching #include #15
- performance profiling #69 #70 and memory optimization, gprof, 2018-05-24 25 26.
- numerical issue: mathematically consistent, but numerically unstable: 2018-01-16 17: #14 #17.
  - distance square vs. intersection calculation; inconsistency lets simulation fail
  - vector operations vs. coordinate-wise calculation #28, 2018-02-13 19 23.
- complicated algorithm -> tests
- computing limits -> cluster, parallelization, thinning, optimizations
- caching

### Optimizations

- ray-tracing list 2017-05-26
- kernel caching #15
- production build without prints and debug outputs #73
- algorithm optimization #21
- parallelization #76
  - filter by range separately #30
  - order mathematical cases by frequency
- memory optimization #69 #70
