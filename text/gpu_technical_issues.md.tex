\subsection{Technical Issues Concerning Graphics Processing Units}
\label{sec:gpu_technical_issues}

- \todo{check numerical issues: are the unclean-cut issues really from numerical issues or caused by the 3d-projection issue?}

- driver issue: isnan #16, caching #include #15
- numerical issue: mathematically consistent, but numerically unstable: 2018-01-16 17: #14 #17.
  - distance square vs. intersection calculation; inconsistency lets simulation fail
  - vector operations vs. coordinate-wise calculation #28, 2018-02-13 19 23.
