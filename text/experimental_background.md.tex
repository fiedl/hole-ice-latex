# Experimental Background
## IceCube Detector
## Digital Optical Modules (DOMs)
## DOM Angular Acceptance Characteristics
## Angular Acceptance Approximations and Their Limitations
% Outdated model for hole-ice properties
% No different properties for each string/DOMs
% DOM is wrongly considered centred in hole ice
## Likelihood Methods for Comparing Simulations to Reference Data
## Ice Models to Characterize Photon Scattering and Absorption in the South-polar Ice
## Hole Ice as Region of Different Ice Properties Around Detector Strings
